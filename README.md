a progress log of my education

December 22, 2015
decided, after much himming&hawing, to properly learn C, AVR, MAX, microcontroller programming, in the name of Jon Ross, music,  
and for all the years I TALKED about wanting to learn this, but smoking heroin & speed instead.  I was fresh out of rehab, 
my brain was going to function soon, it was time to walk the walk. 

Jan 22, 2016
Started the eDx course "embedded systems: shape the world", led by Jonathon Valvano & prof. Yeraballi. at UT Austin. (ARM based course)
(around the same time)  began Elliot Williams book  Make: AVR programming.




4/18/2016 : Shit or get of the pot - started "Delicious Max Tutorials". I need to stop being afraid of the things that intimidate me. 
  Max is easy as shit to get into.  I looked into this software 12 years ago and shyed away.  Not anymore.  
  The "karplus strong' Max/MSP tutorial got my machine properly making noise, 
  and when I went home, I created an LFO output with Motu ultralight with a proper 10v PtP signal for controlling my eurorack. 

4/28/2016 : Completed up to Lesson 6: Bitwise operators in C of Embedded Systems Programming (Quantam Leaps youtube)
  this guy is good. Explaining deep Assembly functions in IAR, very detailed descript.
