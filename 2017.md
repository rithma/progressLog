#  2017 begins.  
Ive got a great Job at Fox 1440 now,   keeping the consoles tame,  keeping the mixers in line.  
I am afforded a little more time these days,  probably more due to my sobriety than anything, 
but it is TIME I can use to learn a few things. 

I spent most of my learning hours in 2016 focusing on C,  embedded systems,  and thats about it. 
I spent a small fortune on books, dev Boards, classes, etc.  

I learned a little.   More about how to think about code and how to understand the whole thing than anything. 

this year I want to continue.    I dont have the same liberty to bring devBoards & launchpads to work anymore, 
but I still pound the Gingko and have an appetite for this shit,    so I dropped 50 bucks on a bunch of udemy classes in one of their 10 dollar sales. 

-The complete Java Devoper Course
-Master android & app development
-The Complete Web Developer course 2.0
-The comlpete ethical hacking course
-The complete Javascript 

I realize this is a big shitshow and probably a lot more than i can handle in 2017,
ALONG WITH   
whatever I am still in the middle of:
     -Learn C the hard way by Zed Shaw
     -
